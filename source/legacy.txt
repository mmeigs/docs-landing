====================
Legacy Documentation
====================

MongoDB encourages upgrading to the most recent version to ensure 
documentation support. If upgrading is not possible, archived 
documentation is still available for previous versions. Archived 
documentation no longer receives updates.  

It is our LEGACY!!!
